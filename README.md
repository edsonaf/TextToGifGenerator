# Text 2 Gif Generator

Created primarily because I wanted text gif's of what I was listening to on Spotify so that I could POST them to my SteelSeries mouse with a small OLED screen. Since this screen was rather small, I couldnt just send text and needed the text to move until the entire text was shown. After googling I found that there did not exist a easy way to generate text Gif and save them. So yours truly has taken code from everywhere and nowhere and put them together to give you this application.

### Enjoy
